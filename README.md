# DarkLightFieldRestoration
The project is the official implementation of our [WACV 2022 paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/papers/Lamba_Fast_and_Efficient_Restoration_of_Extremely_Dark_Light_Fields_WACV_2022_paper.pdf), "Fast and Efficient Restoration of Extremely Dark Light Fields"

Patent pending. Because of conflict with patent releasing a demo code only. Because of huge size of LFs we are uploading **pre-processed** numpy arrays in compressed format and can be fetched from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bjFKbEnTw2sbKfEAdGFf8vdSL04yYdEC?usp=sharing).

Simply put the pre_processed numpy arrays in a folder called `low_light_LFs_compressed` and then execute `demo.py`. Thats it !! Restored LFs will be saved in GIF format and one example is shown in `restored.gif`
