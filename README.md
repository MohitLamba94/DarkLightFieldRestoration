# DarkLightFieldRestoration
The project is the official implementation of our WACV 2022 paper, "Fast and Efficient Restoration of Extremely Dark Light Fields"

Patent pending. Full code release after Patent. Because of huge size of LFs we are uploading **pre-processed** numpy arrays in compressed format and can be fetched from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bjFKbEnTw2sbKfEAdGFf8vdSL04yYdEC?usp=sharing).

Simply put the pre_processed numpy arrays in a folder called `low_light_LFs_compressed` and then execute `demo.py`. Thats it !! Restored LFs will be saved in GIF format and one example is shown in `restored.gif`
